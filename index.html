<h1>Invisible Rush &ndash; Account and Data Deletion</h1>
<h3>Invisible Rush is developed by Games Factory Dev.</h3>
<p>The game itself does not require users to create an account in order to play.<br />However, if a user chooses to connect to the leaderboard feature using the "Connect" button, this will redirect them to create or use an existing GDevelop account.</p>
<h3>How to delete my entire GDevelop account</h3>
<p>To initiate a full account deletion, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the GDevelop app (mobile app, desktop app or the&nbsp;<a href="https://editor.gdevelop.io/">web app</a>).</li>
<li>Login with your profile, if it's not already done.</li>
<li>Open your profile page by clicking on your username in the GDevelop homepage.</li>
<li>In your&nbsp;<strong>Profile</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Edit my profile</strong>.</li>
<li>At the bottom, click&nbsp;<strong>Delete my account</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Validate your choice after clicking on&nbsp;<strong>Delete my account</strong>. Your account will be removed and inaccessible soon after.</p>
<p>Data that will be deleted:<br />- Leaderboard-related data (such as scores and user identifiers)<br />- GDevelop account data associated with the leaderboard connection</p>
<p>Data retention:<br />- Data deletion is handled by GDevelop according to their privacy policy.<br />- Invisible Rush does not store or retain any personal user data on its own servers.</p>
